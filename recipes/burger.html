      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium red bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium tomato, seeded and chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 pounds ground chicken</li>
      <li>½ cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon seafood seasoning</li>
      <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Lightly spray a skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat.
        Add onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and
        cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add carrots, bell pepper, tomato,
        and mushrooms; cook and stir until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from
        the heat and let cool completely, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix ground chicken and cooled vegetables together in a large bowl. Add
        bread crumbs, egg, seafood seasoning, salt, and pepper; mix until well
        combined. Form mixture into eight patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the
        juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees
        C).
