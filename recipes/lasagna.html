      A delicious Spinach and Turkey Lasagna for those who are health conscious
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 pound ground turkey breast</li>
      <li>3 cups tomato sauce</li>
      <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>6 cups chopped fresh spinach</li>
      <li>2 cups fat-free ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion;
        cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about
        2 minutes. Add ground turkey and cook 5 to 7 minutes more, stirring to
        break up any large chunks of meat. Stir in tomato sauce, mushrooms,
        Italian seasoning, black pepper, and garlic powder. Simmer for 2 minutes
        and season to salt
      </li>
      <li>Combine spinach, ricotta, and nutmeg in a large bowl.</li>
      <li>
        To assemble, arrange 3 noodles lengthwise in the bottom of a greased
        9x13 inch baking dish. Spread with 1/3 the ricotta mixture, 1/3 of the
        turkey mixture, and 1/3 of the mozzarella. Repeat layers, ending with
        remaining mozzarella. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Cool for 5
        minutes before serving.
